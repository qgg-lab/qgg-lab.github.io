### Farewell to Jinding Liu and Welcome to Rodrigo Pelicioni Savegnago

{{ page.date | date: "%m-%d-%Y" }}

Dr. Jinding Liu, who was a visiting scholar with us for the last two years, has returned to China. Jinding single-handedly built the ASlive server and was wrapping up another great web service focused on plants before he left. We look forward to bringing it online soon!

Meanwhile, Dr. Rodrigo Pelicioni Savegnago has joined the lab as a postdoc. Rodrigo was working with our lab neighbor Cedric Gondro for the last 2.5 years and he will be working with myself, Cedric and Juan Steibel on building an imputation resource in pigs. Welcome Rodrigo!
