### Farewell to Jie Yang and welcome to Danyue Kang and Rongrong Ding

{{ page.date | date: "%m-%d-%Y" }}

We recently waved farewell to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/people.html">Jie Yang</a>, who after a productive year here, returned to his faculty position at South China Agricultural University.

Shortly after Jie left, we welcomed our newest members to the lab. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/people.html">Danyue Kang</a> is a junior in Animal Science at MSU and will be doing some fly work with us. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/people.html">Rongrong Ding</a> is a graduate student at South China Agricultural University will spend a year with us. His project involves using automatic feeder data in pigs to perform phenotyping of feeding efficiency and behavior traits and genetic analysis.
