### Farewell to Rongrong Ding

{{ page.date | date: "%m-%d-%Y" }}

We are both happy and sad to say goodbye to Rongrong Ding, who returns to South China Agricultural University to finish his Ph.D. While at MSU in the past year, Rongrong had done great work on processing high throughput phenotype data from automatic feeder as well as on developing reference haplotype panels for genotype imputation, both in pigs.

The lab went out for lunch in honor of Rongrong:
