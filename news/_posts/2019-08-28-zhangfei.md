### Welcome to Fei Zhang

{{ page.date | date: "%m-%d-%Y" }}

We are happy to welcome <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/people.html">Fei Zhang</a>, our laboratory's first graduate student. Fei is enrolled in the Animal Science graduate program and his thesis work started with mapping splice QTLs in pigs. He brought to us rich past experience in next generation sequencing data analysis and database and web servers. We look forward to a fun and productive graduate training with Fei.
