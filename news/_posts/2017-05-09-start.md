### Lab starts 2017 summer and students/postdocs wanted

{{ page.date | date: "%m-%d-%Y" }}

Our lab of quantitative genetics and genomics in the department of animal science at Michigan State University will open doors in the summer of 2017. We study the genetics of complex quantitative traits in livestock animals, model organisms such as *Drosophila melanogaster*, and humans. We use a variaty of experimental and computational approaches. 

We are always looking for students and postdocs to join us and welcome any background. We would be willing to discuss various possibilities. Our lab can accept students through the <a href="https://genetics.natsci.msu.edu" target="blank">genetics</a> and <a href="http://www.canr.msu.edu/ans/students/graduate_program/" target="blank">animal science</a> graduate programs at MSU.
