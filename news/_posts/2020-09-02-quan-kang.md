### Farewell to Jianping Quan and Danyue Kang

{{ page.date | date: "%m-%d-%Y" }}

We are both happy and sad to say goodbye to Jianping, who returns to South China Agricultural University to finish his Ph.D. While at MSU in the past year, Jianping had done great work and published one paper on microbiome diversity among pigs with different feed efficiency.

Our star undergraduate student Danyue Kang, who won a Undergraduate Research Project award from the college to work on diet by genotype interaction while in the lab, starts her Vet school at Ohio State this fall.
