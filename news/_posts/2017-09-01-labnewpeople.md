Our lab officially opened doors in July, 2017, when <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/people.html">Wen Huang</a> started his job.  
 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/people.html">Nancy Raney</a> started at the same time as a lab manager. Nancy has been working for MSU since 1997 and is busy getting the labs set up.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/people.html">Zhijun Dai</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/people.html">Jie Yang</a> both started on the 1st of September. Zhijun is a bioinformaticist and a junior faculty member at Hunan Agricultural University and will be working on developing ways to improve genomic prediction. Jie is a swine geneticist and lecturer at South China Agricultural University. He will stay with us for a year and will be working on the analysis aspects of the various projects that he has developed in China.

We welcome our newest (also oldest) members and look forward to the exciting research.
