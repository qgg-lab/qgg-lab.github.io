|<small>B.S.  (biotechnology)</small>       | <small>1993</small> | <small>University of Kentucky</small> |

I have been a lab manager at MSU since 1997. In addition to the Huang Lab, I am also lab manager for two other faculty members. I received my B.S. and M.S. from the University of Kentucky. In addition to conducting research, I am responsible for overseeing the routine functioning of the laboratory as well as training students. When I’m not at work, I’m busy trying to keep up with my five-year old twin girls.

Life is fantastic, but also complicated. It is of importance and interest to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits, and breed animals with great performance and production traits. My primary research interest is using genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics to deal with problems in animal science.
