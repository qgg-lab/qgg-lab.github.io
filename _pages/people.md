|<small>B.S.  (biotechnology)</small>       | <small>1994</small> | <small>University of Kentucky</small> |

I have been a lab manager at MSU since 1997. In addition to the Huang Lab, I am also lab manager for two other faculty members. I received my B.S. and M.S. from the University of Kentucky. In addition to conducting research, I am responsible for overseeing the routine functioning of the laboratory as well as training students. When I’m not at work, I’m busy trying to keep up with my twin girls.
