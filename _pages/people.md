|<small>B.S.  (biotechnology)</small>       | <small>1993</small> | <small>University of Kentucky</small> |

I have been a lab manager at MSU since 1997. In addition to the Huang Lab, I am also lab manager for two other faculty members. I received my B.S. and M.S. from the University of Kentucky. In addition to conducting research, I am responsible for overseeing the routine functioning of the laboratory as well as training students. When I’m not at work, I’m busy trying to keep up with my five-year old twin girls.

|<small>B.S. (plant protection)</small> | <small>2013</small> | <small>Nanjing Agricultural University</small> |

I am an entomologist, focusing on a variety of insect pests from the fruit flies to the red flour beetles. My current research project is conducting molecular biology, fly genetics, and biometrics to get some clues on fundamental aspects of the central dogma.

|<small>B.S. (animal science)</small> | <small>2005</small> | <small>Hawassa University, Ethiopia</small> |


Broadly, I am interested in factors that control genetic variation and how these can be utilised in quantitative genetics. Particularly, I am interested in genome wide association study, genomic prediction and methods of estimating genetic parameters for performance and disease traits in various species.
