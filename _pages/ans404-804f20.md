## ANS404/804 Introduction to quantitative genetics
### Fall, 2020

#### Description

Quantitative trait variation is pervasive in nature, it can be found among individuals in populations of virtually all life forms. For many quantitative traits, including in particular production of plants and animals, disease risks of humans, genetics contributes a significant part. Quantitative genetics is the discipline that deals with how the heritable (genetic) part of quantitative trait variation originates, dynamically changes, pass on to next generations. This is important for genetic improvement of food animals and crops, development of diagnosis and treatments of genetic diseases, and understanding evolution. 

This course covers the basics of quantitative genetics and is highly recommended for students who seek advanced and/or professional studies in genetics and employment opportunities in the breeding industry. Topics include the life cycle and properties of mutations, population parameters of genetic effects and phenotypes and their properties (means, variances, breeding values, heritability), dynamics of mutations and genetic variation (genetic drift, selection), quantitative genetics in the molecular era (mapping, prediction).

_This course covers the general principles of quantitative genetics and should be applicable across species (animals, plants, model organisms, humans, etc.)_

#### Prerequisite

Students with prior preparation in genetics (molecular or quantitative, any level, e.g. ANS314) and statistics (basic statistical treatment of data, e.g. STT200) will be expected do well. However, all necessary background knowledge will be reviewed in lecture and further references will be provided.

#### Course Objectives

The main objective is to introduce to the students theories of quantitative genetics and their applications in breeding practices. The students will be able to understand the fundamental genetic principles governing variation of quantita- tive traits in populations; explain complex genetic concepts integratively using theories and real life examples; develop quantitative and critical thinking abilities; quantitatively analyze genetic data, interpret and communicate results.

Students will meet these objectives by a) attending lectures and understanding materials; b) studying and completing homework assignments; c) participating in in-class discussion.
