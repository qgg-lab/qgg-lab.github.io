#### Postdocs

We are always looking for motivated postdocs who have a genuine interest in quantitative genetics. Our lab employs a combination of experimental and computational approaches and uses fruit flies, livestock animals, and data in human populations. It's likely you will find something that interests you! Get in touch with the PI (huangw53 AT msu.edu) for an informal inquiry.



#### Graduate students

We recruit graduate students through the [Animal Science Graduate Program](https://www.canr.msu.edu/ans/students/graduate_program/index) (direct admit) and the [BioMolecular Science Gateway](https://biomolecular.natsci.msu.edu) (lab rotations in first year). Feel free to contact the PI (huangw53 AT msu.edu).



#### Undergraduate students

There are two types of undergradaute students in our lab, those who work as a student employee and those who perform research work for course credit or as a volunteer. Arrangements will be made depending on specific nature of the work and situtations of the students. Please reach out to the PI (huangw53 AT msu.edu) for potential opportunities.
